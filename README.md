# Swarm City Terminal

The Swarm City Terminal is the starting point of the user journey in Swarm City. The Swarm City Terminal will be the main entry screen into the Swarm City ecosystem and will be the browser for the hashtags, starting with #ridesharing. It provides the Swarm City citizens the possibility to create and manage a basic profile and to exchange SWT tokens in a wallet.

## New user
You begin with Swarm City by opening the app (terminal.swarm.city) and creating a password encrypted wallet, thereby creating an account.

## New session on device 
Once you have the wallet, you can open the app and unlock it by entering its password.

## Terminal
Once the app is open and unlocked, you enter Terminal view where you see an empty avatar, username, and balance as well as a reference currency and an overview of all available games provided by Swarm City.

## Profile
By clicking on the Profile picture or the username, you go to the Profile view.
On the profile view, you see your profile picture and username, your transaction history, a button to make a backup, and a shortcode to sync another device.

You can personalize your account by changing your Profile picture and username. Upload a picture file or take a picture with your device's camera. Crop it if you wish before saving.  You can also set a reference currency - e.g., BTC, ETH, USD, EUR, YEN - that corresponds to your Swarm City token (SWT).   You can see both your SWT and reference currency balance there as well as your transaction history. 

## Making a backup
If you haven't yet made a backup of your account, you will see a warning sign by your avatar and username.  It will be there as long as you haven't made a backup. Clicking on it, or on the avatar/username, you go to Profile view where you can see instructions to make a backup.

Making a backup and reliably saving it involves downloading your account's JSON file to your cloud or other reliable backup storage.

## Wallet
By clicking on Balance in Terminal, you enter the Wallet view where you can see your SWT balance, the reference currency, a button to do a transaction, and a button to top up your SWT token balance.

You can send tokens to another user by entering the amount and the shortcode of the receiver and sending, whereupon the system will show the status of your send.

You can receive tokens by giving another user send funds to your shortcode.

## Importing ARC tokens
The SWT token can import an ARC wallet and automatically convert your ARC tokens into SWT tokens.

## Importing a backup file
You can import a SWT wallet by uploading its JSON file and entering its password or by entering the private key from the paper wallet.

You can transfer SWT tokens straight from any other wallet into the SWT Terminal by making a transaction that sends to the address of your account.

## Existing user on a new device
If you're an existing user and you want to install Swarm City on a new device, you need to upload or sync your existing account.   Uploading involves uploading a previously backed up JSON account file.  Synching involves connecting to a device that already has your account and getting its shortcode from its Profile view and entering it into your new device.
